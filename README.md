# 🎭 Generating Anime Faces with GANs

This project demonstrates how to generate **anime-style faces** using **Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)** implemented in **PyTorch**.  
The notebook walks through training a GAN model on an anime face dataset to produce realistic, high-quality images.

## 🧠 Overview

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two networks:

- **Generator**: Creates synthetic anime face images from random noise.  
- **Discriminator**: Distinguishes between real and generated images.

Training these networks together allows the generator to produce increasingly realistic anime faces.
